title: System-Wide Arguments
---

## Description
System-wide arguments are standardized parameters available to all tools within the RAG framework. These arguments provide essential contextual information, enabling tools to operate with user-specific, session-specific, and intention-specific data. The inclusion of these parameters allows each tool to function cohesively within the broader system.

1. **`userId`**:
- **Description**: Unique identifier for the current user.
- **Usage**: Passed to tools to ensure data access and retrieval are specific to the user, enabling secure, personalized operations.
2. **`intention`**:
- **Description**: A brief description of the user’s purpose or query, providing context for the tool’s actions.
- **Usage**: Helps tools align their processing to the user’s intended outcome, ensuring responses are relevant and contextually accurate.
3. **`threadId`**:
- **Description**: Unique identifier for the conversation or session thread.
- **Usage**: Allows tools to manage and track data across a conversation, providing continuity within a single user interaction.
