title: Tool Argument-Based Caching
---

## Overview
Tool Argument-Based Caching is a caching mechanism within the RAG framework that stores and retrieves tool results based on the specific arguments passed to each tool. By caching results based on a combination of tool name, user ID, and arguments, this approach allows the framework to deliver efficient, repeatable results for identical requests, reducing redundant processing and improving response times.

This system leverages Redis as the caching backend, storing results with unique keys that are generated based on tool-specific arguments and excluding non-essential arguments, such as `intention`, from the cache key for more consistent retrieval.

## How It Works

1. **Unique Cache Key Generation:**
   - For each tool call, a unique cache key is generated based on the toolâ€™s name and its arguments.
   - Before generating the key, the intention argument (if present) is removed, ensuring that only essential parameters affect the caching process.
   - Example Key Format: `<functionName> + JSON.stringify(argumentsWithoutIntention)`
2. **Cache Lookup:**
   - When a tool is called, the cache is checked first for a matching entry using the generated key.
   - If a cached value exists, it is returned immediately, bypassing the tool call and reducing processing time.
   - If no cached result is found, the tool is executed, and the result is stored in the cache for future retrieval.
3. **Tool Call Execution and Caching:**
   - If a cache hit does not occur, the tool is executed with the provided arguments.
   - Once the tool returns a result, it is serialized and stored in the cache with the generated key, ensuring the result can be reused for future calls with the same arguments.


## Example Usage Scenario
1.	**User Query:** The user requests recent transactions filtered by a specific date range.
2.	**Tool Call and Cache Check:**  The `get_user_transactions` tool is called with arguments specifying the date range. The cache key is generated based on the function name and date range.
3.	**Cache Hit:** If a previous query used the same arguments, the result is returned from the cache.
4.	**Cache Miss:** If no cache entry is found, the tool executes the query, and the result is cached with the generated key for future requests.
