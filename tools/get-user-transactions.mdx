title: Get User Transactions
---

## Description
The Get User Transactions tool retrieves transactions for the current user with various filter options (e.g., currencies, banks, companies, partners, date range). If the number of transactions exceeds a threshold, they are saved to a temporary file on the filesystem, allowing for efficient data handling, especially with large datasets. The file response includes a structured schema, allowing other tools (e.g., Python processing tools) to understand and access the dataset efficiently.

## Arguments

- `currencies (array[string])`: List of currency codes to filter transactions.
- `banks (array[string])`: List of banks to filter by. The `get_user_banks` tool can provide available bank options.
- `companies (array[string])`: List of companies to filter by. Use `get_user_companies` to retrieve available companies.
- `partners (array[string])`: List of partners (companies or individuals) associated with transactions. Use `get_user_partners` to obtain partner options.
- `start_date (string)`: Start date for filtering transactions.
- `end_date (string)`: End date for filtering transactions.
- `limit (number)`: Limits the number of transactions returned. Default is 20,000 if unspecified.

## Response Handling
Successful Response: If the number of transactions is:
    - Small (less than or equal to 50): Returns a structured JSON object with a transactions_list.
    - Large (greater than 50): Saves transactions to a temporary file and returns the file path.
- Error Handling: If the retrieval or file saving fails, an error message is logged, and details are returned for debugging.

## Example Usage

1. User Query: “Retrieve my transactions from January 2023, filtered by EUR currency.”
2. Agent Invocation: The agent calls get_user_transactions with:
    - currencies: ["EUR"]
    - start_date: "2023-01-01"
    - end_date: "2023-01-31"
    - intention: "Retrieve user transactions in EUR for January 2023"
3. Response:
    - If ≤ 50 transactions are found, returns as a JSON list.
- If > 50 transactions are found, returns a file path for the saved data.
