title: Principles

The RAG framework is built on a set of core principles designed to deliver flexible, context-driven AI solutions across applications. Each of the following core concepts is a key component of the framework.

## Core Concepts

<Card title="Applications" href="/concept/applications">
  Each application using the RAG framework has its own configuration, tailored
  to its unique requirements. Applications can define specific system prompts,
  custom tools, enabled agents, and LLM model preferences to align with their
  individual workflows and data needs.
</Card>
<Card title="Tool Repository" href="/concept/tool-repository">
  The Tool Repository is a centralized collection of tools used by agents to
  complete tasks. It includes general-purpose tools, which offer broad
  functionality, and app-specific tools, which are custom-built to meet unique
  application requirements. Each tool follows a structured input and output
  schema for consistent integration.
</Card>
<Card title="Agents" href="/concept/agents">
  Agents are specialized AI entities configured with profiles that determine
  their behavior, workflow type, and the tools they can access. Agents process
  user requests by selecting and sequencing tools.
</Card>
<Card title="Dynamically Generated Pipelines" href="/concept/pipelines">
  Agents generate pipelines by breaking down complex tasks into subtasks, each
  associated with a specific tool. These pipelines follow an
  Input-Process-Output (IPO) loop with error-handling and self-correction
  capabilities, allowing the agent to adapt dynamically and handle complex
  workflows.
</Card>
<Card title="Vectorization" href="/concept/vectorization">
  Vectorization is the process of transforming content into vector embeddings to
  enable efficient and semantically relevant retrieval.
