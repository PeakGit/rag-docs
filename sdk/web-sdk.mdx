## JavaScript SDK for Web Integration

1. **Shadow DOM Technology:**
- Renders HTML elements independently, preserving your appâ€™s design.
- Limitations: Currently, only system fonts are supported.
2. **Chat Window Integration:**
- Embed the chat window in any HTML element as a full-page view, a floating button, or a sidebar, providing flexible integration options.
3. **Chat Behavior Management:**
- The SDK manages the chat session automatically. When a user initiates a conversation, a thread ID is saved in LocalStorage, allowing the chat to persist across sessions.
4. **Proactive Suggestions:**
- Our AI assistant can suggest questions proactively, guiding the conversation and enhancing the user experience. This feature can be disabled through the SDK settings.
